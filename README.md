# Kontrol 2 by Nedd. But why Kontrol 2? Cause Kontrol 1 sucked
Remote Administration Tool written fully in C# and powered by Net 6 with it's awesomeness.

# Features
Can do everything that all RAT's do.

# Why Kontrol 2?
Don't. This is only for educational purposes only. 

If you want to do naughty stuff with this then you're stupid cause there are better RAT's out there. Go download them bruh!

(Most anti viruses including Windows defender don't detect Kontrol 2 as a threat unlike other RAT's out there)
